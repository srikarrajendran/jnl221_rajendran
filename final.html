			<h3>What is ShotSpotter?</h3>

			<p>ShotSpotter is a gunfire locator service which uses audio sensors and microphones to try and detect the sound of gunshots. According to a report put together by the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP), “ShotSpotter’s call center employees receive an ‘audio snippet’ of loud sounds flagged as possible gunshots. Based on a ShotSpotter job advertisement, the criteria for this position include a year of experience in a call center or in customer service and the mysterious ability to ‘listen to audible notifications with a high level of accuracy.’” Particularly in the city of Chicago, ShotSpotter has become a part of law enforcement and is used as a means of an alert. The underlying issue with the service has been its frequency of non-gunfire detection. Now, more cities have been utilizing ShotSpotter and money is being drawn into the service. Mayor of Chicago Brandon Johnson extended ShotSpotter’s contract in his city, investing more than $10 million into the technology. This move came with lots of controversy due to the negative stigma that was already around ShotSpotter. The death of Adam Toledo in 2021 was a turning point. ShotSpotter alerted law enforcement to the West Side of Chicago and the subsequent events resulted in an innocent 13-year-old Toledo being shot and killed by the Chicago Police Department (CPD). I analyzed a dataset compiled by the City of Chicago to look into Shotspotter’s issues more while also finding statistics that key into gun violence problems in the city. </p>

			<h3>What month is getting the most alerts?</h3>
			<p>Nearly 12% of all alerts over the course of a year were in January. There could be a few different reasons as to why that is. Usually during New Year’s eve, people tend to set off firecrackers in celebration. These loud pops could have been identified as gunshots by ShotSpotter due to the technology not having the full capacity to differentiate the pop of a gun and the pop of a firework or firecracker. Every other month hovered at around 3000 to 4000 alerts but January was the only month to cross the 5000 alerts threshold. When looking deeper into the months that got the most alerts, the classification of “gunshot or firecracker” was most prominent in the summer months (June, July, August). Over 600 of about 2000 alerts with this classification happened over summer.</p>

			<h3>Which area is getting the most alerts?</h3>
			<p>Austin got the most alerts of any community area in Chicago. 2,805 alerts were in that specific location while 152 of those were classified as a gunshot or firecracker. Austin is located on the west side of Chicago. After Austin, South Shore and South Chicago were the two areas that garnered the most alerts with the classification of gunshot or firecracker. The majority of the rest were under 100 alerts with that classification. However, a total of 17 community areas got more than 1000 alerts in general. While Shotspotter may not be the most reliable when determining whether an alert is for an actual gunshot, alerts are mostly correct during this timeframe. It should be noted that this does not underscore the frequency of misfires from the service. </p>

			<h3>What are the different types of alerts and how many of each were there over the course of a year?</h3>
			<p>There are three different types of alerts that the Chicago Police Department used when compiling the data: Single gunshot, multiple gunshots, and gunshot or firecracker. The latter category is a bit more shrouded in mystery considering the other two are more clear cut. However the “or” is used to signify that there was no follow up on whether the alert was for a gunshot or fireworks. This does impact the data due to not having the clarity necessary to know whether an alert was truly a false alarm. Sarah Roth, advocacy and communications associate with the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP), noted the faulty technology and how alerts can quickly go awry. “The technology itself is not good,” Roth remarked. “I think that’s the biggest problem with it and also how it is applied…Because there’s factors like buildings being in the way and the wind, it’s bad at identifying what the sound is and where it is coming from.” Just over 2000 alerts were classified as a gunshot or firecracker. On the other hand, about 40,000 alerts were either a single gunshot or multiple gunshots. With more money being invested into Shotspotter, it is yet to be seen if the technology gets upgraded or if it largely remains the same.</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>ShotSpotter’s inconsistencies in Chicago have mainly been highlighted in Austin, South Shore and South Chicago, where more than 100 alerts were identified as a gunshot or firecracker. January is the most active month of alerts by a wide margin while also leading in the gunshot or firecracker classification. This finding clouds whether or not the high amount of alerts is due to New Year’s celebrations or actual gunfire. The future of ShotSpotter in Chicago is very much in question, even with a new contract being given out. As more money gets invested into the service, it is yet to be seen whether any changes get made to the technology to ensure more reliability going forward.</p>
